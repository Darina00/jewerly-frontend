# React application - jewerly store

 To start the application, download the archive and issue the 
 ```yarn start```
 command.
 
 The application uses data from the [backend](https://jewerly.herokuapp.com/graphql) that I wrote.

It is impossible for an unregistered user to place an order (there is no purchase button).

You can register in the system, or you can already go to the created profile.

For example, login 
```Darina```
, password 
```qazwsx0987```


In your personal account, you can view information about your account and about your orders.
